# DataMesh - A Scalable Backend Solution

## Project Description
*DataMesh* is a backend framework designed to provide modular, scalable, and secure solutions for distributed systems. It features multiple microservices for handling user authentication, data management, and notifications. Built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Docker, it is optimized for handling high traffic and large datasets.

## Key Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Scalable services with well-defined API contracts.
- **Secure Authentication**: User login and token-based authentication with JWT.
- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: Real-time notifications with RabbitMQ.
- **RESTful APIs**: All services expose REST APIs for easy integration.
- **Containerized**: Easily deployable using Docker.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Testing**: Pytest
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus (optional for future versions)
